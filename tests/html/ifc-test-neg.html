Negative test for IFC policy
Page based on https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_formenctype
To run the test, execute ./mach run tests/html/ifc-test-neg.html from the project root directory.

Expected result is a panic originated from the IFC library, as it has detected a flow explicitly
disallowed by our custom policy (where keyboard input can only be sent to the same domain that
the page was loaded from).

For a positive test, use
./mach run "https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_formenctype"
instead.
