Negative test for IFC policy
Page based on https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_formenctype
To run the test, first run python3 ifc-test-server.py in this directory, then execute
./mach run http://127.0.0.1:8000/neg from the project root directory.

Expected result is a panic originated from the IFC library, as it has detected a flow explicitly
disallowed by our custom policy (where keyboard input can only be sent to the same domain that
the page was loaded from).

To run the positive test, see the instructions in ifc-test-pos.html.
